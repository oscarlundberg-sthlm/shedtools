# ðŸ”© Shed Tools ðŸ”§ 

Shed tools are basically some things I've been missing in dev tools when doing frontend development:

- Being able to measure distances on screen in pixels.  
- Being able to create vertical grids overlaying the website.  
- Being able to hover an element, see it's content-, padding- and margin-boxes while also being able to lock it so that you can move your mouse away from it and still show the boxes.  
- While an element is "locked" with its boxes showing, being able to hover over another element to see how they relate.

## Usage alternatives

- put this code inside the head tag:  
`<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/oscarlundberg-sthlm/shedtools@latest/shedtools.js" defer></script>`

- or clone the repository/download the zip, and use the folder as a chrome extension: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked

- copy/paste the shedtools.js code right into the console if you want it quickly/temporarily on a live website.
