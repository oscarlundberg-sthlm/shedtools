# shed tools

Some things I've been missing in dev tools when doing frontend development.

- Being able to measure distances on screen in pixels.
- Being able to create vertical grids overlaying the website.
- Being able to select an element, see it's content-, padding- and margin-boxes, and being able to lock it so that you can move your mouse away from it and still show the boxes.
- While an element is "locked" with its boxes showing, being able to hover over another element to see how they relate.

The code is in a single js file for ease of use.
Hot tip! Copy/paste the javascript code right into the console if you want it quickly/temporarily on a live website.
